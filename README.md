# Symple
A simple python framework.

### Abstractions
 - Something that should accept TCP connections and schedule an asynchronous function to handle them.
 - Something to parse raw text into some kind of abstracted container.
 - Something to decide which function should be called for each request.
 - Something that bundles all the above together and presents a simple interface to a developer.
